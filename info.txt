Created two get requests

1. The first request search for the info based on the name of the movie inputted
    Because its searching with the name it doesnt bring out the movie genre instead it just brings out the id

    So after the first request I get the id of the movie searched

2. The second request then searches with the id instead of with the name as the earlier get request
    and searching with the id instead of the name brings out the list of the genre not just their id
